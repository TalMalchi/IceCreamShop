# My IceCreamShop
* Written by Guy Azoulay and Tal Malchi.

## Main Goal of our Project:
In this assigment we built our own IceCream Shop using 2 main Data bases: SQL and MongoDB.
Thanks to this assigment we improved our coding skills and started to really understand what is to "think outside of a box",
and understand how the SQL and MongoDB work behind the scene.



### How to connect to MongoDB?
- Install MongoDB compass to your computre
- Create new local connection
- Run on the terminal `dotnet add package MongoDB.Driver`
- Then run: `dotnet run IceCreamShop.cs`
